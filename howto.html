        <p>
        You should select your desired mode via the drop-down selection menu. Modes are calculated on the average word length as well as how many special characters like capitals, numbers, and symbols are included in the text. As default, it will choose a test at random. Furthermore, if you just want random, chose 'Random' in the drop down! (or stay on Select, if you really want)
        </p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p>
        Your prompt will be given to you in the white box and your cursor will begin at the first letter of the first word. Words from the prompt may be cut short and moved to the next line. You may notice there are no hyphens when there are these word breaks; this is to avoid confusion during your test. 
        </p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p>
        Begin typing whenever you’re ready and the 60-second timer will begin to count down. Type for as fast as you can, for as long as you can, until the timer runs out.
        </p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p>
        You can fix errors as you go, correct them at the end, or not at all - it’s up to you! Fixing errors can improve your accuracy, but can lower your WPM/CPM. 
        </p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p>
        If you need to restart the test, press the ‘Try Again’ button, under the prompt area, at any time. Interactive feedback shows you your current wpm and accuracy.
        </p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p>
        At the end of the test, your results will remain under the prompt until you refresh the page or press ‘Try Again’.
