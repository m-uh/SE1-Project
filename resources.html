        <h2>How can I increase my typing speed?</h2>
        <p>
          The best way to increase typing speed is to learn to type correctly using the method of “Touch typing” instead of using a “hunt and peck”. </p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;
          <h2>What is Touch Typing?</h2>
          <p>Touch typing means you are able to type with all 10 fingers without looking at the keyboard. It involves using muscle memory to find keys quickly and accurately. Mastering touch typing can greatly enhance your typing speed and efficiency.</p>
          <p>You can practice typing and building your speed by playing typing games, such as this one. </p>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraphs are AI-generated as a way to quickly get a large number of various paragraphs with specific rules (length, symbols, vowels, etc.). 
      The algorithm calculates the difficulty depending on the average word length as well as how many special characters like capitals, numbers, and symbols are included in the text. No information from these prompts claims to be true or reliable in any way.
